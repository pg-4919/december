# December #
A monumental amount of work was put into creating the four seasons of the December SMP, and in my opinion, it was well worth the effort.

Here you can find the modpacks and datapacks used in the last three seasons. The majority of the mods are optimization, with some extra features such as armor stands and proximity chat. The datapacks are largely crafting tweaks, with some further gameplay modifications from the team at Vanilla Tweaks.

The mods are all Fabric. I seem to recall Season 2 was 1.18, and I know Season 4 was 1.19, so Season 3 was also likely 1.18.

You can navigate the repository through the branches on GitHub.

*Note: Season 2 only contains the custom datapack I wrote. The mods are fairly standard server optimization mods, in case you want to know.*

Rest in peace, December. Long live the Igloo Empire.
